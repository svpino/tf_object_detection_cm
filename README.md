# Confusion Matrix in Object Detection with TensorFlow

This script generates a confusion matrix using the detections record file generated by the `/object_detection/inference/infer_detections.py` script.

For a full description of the format of the matrix, and how it is computed, take a look at the [Confusion Matrix in Object Detection with TensorFlow](https://www.shiftedup.com/2018/10/10/confusion-matrix-in-object-detection-api-with-tensorflow) article.

To run this script you need a couple of things:

* The label map used by your model — This is the proto-buff file that you created in order to train your model.
  
* A detection record file — This is the file generated by using the `/object_detection/inference/infer_detections.py`. This script runs a TFRecord file through your model and saves the results in a detection record file. 

Here is an example of running the script:

```
python confusion_matrix.py --detections_record=testing_detections.record --label_map=label_map.pbtxt --output_path=confusion_matrix.csv
```

The script will print the confusion matrix along with precision and recall information to the standard output and save the precision/recall results to the specified output area. 

## Sometimes things fail, so read up

Since I published this repository, the single most reported issue is some flavor of the following error:

```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "confusion_matrix.py", line 133, in <module>

  File "/home/ubuntu/anaconda3/lib/python3.6/site-packages/tensorflow/python/platform/app.py", line 125, in run

    self.field_name].HasField("bytes_list") else None

```

For some weird reason, I've been too lazy to add an answer to this documentation, so I've gotten a bunch of reports and I've kept pointing everyone to issue #1 where I explained how to solve the problem. That ends today. 

The problem is with the TensorFlow library and the solution is [explained here](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/issues/3252). Unfortunately, you'll have to patch your local copy of TensorFlow to get around it.

Here is the relevant section of the link that explains what you need to do (quote below):

> I had same error with Python3.5 and TF1.5. This causes tf_example.features.feature[self.field_name].bytes_list.value returns byte type instead of string type in metrics/tf_example_parser.StringParser.
> 
> So I changed tf_example_parser.StringParser below

```
class StringParser(data_parser.DataToNumpyParser):
  """Tensorflow Example string parser."""
  def __init__(self, field_name):
    self.field_name = field_name
  def parse(self, tf_example):
    if tf_example.features.feature[self.field_name].HasField("bytes_list"):
        result = tf_example.features.feature[self.field_name].bytes_list.value
        result = "".join([x if type(x)=='str' else x.decode('utf-8') for x in result])
    else:
        result = None
    return result
```

I don't like to patch things, and probably you neither. But I promise this one is extremely simple. Find `metrics/tf_example_parser`, and make the above change. It'll take you a minute to be up and running.
